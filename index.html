          Hello! I am a computer science enthusiast who has pursued both my undergraduate and masters degree in the
          field.
          With three years of experience as a software engineer, I have had the opportunity to work in two start-ups
          based
          in India. I am particularly interested in the field of machine learning, and am constantly exploring the
          exciting world of AI and deep learning.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to my interest in machine learning, I also enjoy working on front-end development. When I'm not
          coding or building models, I love to indulge in my hobbies of art and travelling. I find great
          inspiration in exploring new places and cultures, and love to capture my experiences through various forms of
          art. It's amazing how much the world has to offer, and I'm always eager to learn and grow through my travels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I'm incredibly passionate about the field of computer science and excited to see where my journey
          takes
          me next!

                My decision to transition to Soroco (a B2B technology startup specializing in AI-driven business
                optimization) was driven by the dynamic nature of startup environments, which
                provide exceptional opportunities for rapid skill development. At Soroco, I've had the chance to wear
                multiple hats, exposing myself to various facets of business and technology.<br><br>

                Constantly engaging with data analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP), I engineered data
                pipelines, transforming raw data into actionable insights through a blend of data
                analysis, Python programming, and SQLAlchemy. I also designed data models and visualizations for Qlik
                Sense, focusing on applications like Process Insights, Application Insights, Email Insights, and Rework
                Analysis, all of which significantly boosted client efficiency and overall productivity.<br><br>

                I took the lead in developing front-end extensions for our data analytics dashboard and used the
                dagre-d3 library to create visually engaging and informative data visualizations. In addition, I managed
                the Git repository for all front-end extensions, consolidating them into a single repository for
                improved organization and accessibility.

                At Kreditbee (a fintech startup), I was not only immersed in a completely new tech stack but also
                consistently recognized by my seniors for my swift grasp of software architecture and proficiency in
                navigating the intricacies of the new tech landscape.<br><br>

                My responsibilities included working extensively with REST APIs (in Go language), AWS lambda functions,
                SQS, and SNS. I proficiently handled the development, deployment, testing, and integration of various
                APIs within the AWS ecosystem.
                This experience allowed me to broaden my skill set significantly and gain a deeper understanding of
                cloud-based technologies and REST APIs.

                During my time at Kreditbee, things moved at quite a pace. In just 11 months, I found myself promoted to
                the role of Senior Software Engineer. Alongside my regular tasks, I was also doing code
                reviews, attending deployement calls and more.<br><br>

                One of the standout moments for me was when I dug into an existing go script and modified the code using
                goroutines and SQL query optimizations - this helped cut our processing time in half! I also took the
                time to put together some comprehensive design documents for our crucial features.<br><br>

                My role covered everything from gathering requirements to development, QA handover, and even production
                release. I was always on the front lines during deployment calls, making sure our projects saw the light
                of day smoothly.
